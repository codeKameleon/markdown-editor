# Markdown Editor

Markdown editor with live preview and copy to clipboard.

## Features

This editor allows you to type some markdown and see a live preview in HTML.
When you are satisfied you can directly copy your text inside the textarea and
paste it in your file where it needs to be !

## Usage

The project uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
to run the app. I used the [markedjs](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)
library to compile markdown and [Semantic-UI-React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) to add a few components and some style.

Start

```
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
